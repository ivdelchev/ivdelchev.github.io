title: About me
---

My name is Ivan Delchev and I am a fullstack software engineer and entrepreneur living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland,  founder of [42matters](https://42matters.com) and creator of [Hacker News Books](http://hackernewsbooks.com), [Hacker Pixels](http://hackerpixels.com) and [HNBuzz](http://hnbuzz.com).

I have been building scalable products for more than ten years, with a focus on containerization and search. To stay up-to-date with technology and product trends, I always try out new things and release them on production.
