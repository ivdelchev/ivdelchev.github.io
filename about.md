My name is Ivan Delchev and I am a software engineer and entrepreneur living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland, founder of [42matters](https://42matters.com) and creator of [Hacker News Books](http://hackernewsbooks.com), [Hacker Pixels](http://hackerpixels.com) and [HNBuzz](http://hnbuzz.com).

Some of the things I've done in no particular order:

* Built 42matters with exceptional co-founders
* Built from scratch and then sold HackerNewsBooks
* Currently VP of Engineering in charge of an amazing engineering team
* Scaling up multiple SaaS products from scratch
* Designed and implemented an API-first SaaS
* The usual backend stuff - Python, Java, Go + Postgres/Mongo
* A bit of high-performance JavaScript (not the usual frontend stuff)
* Implemented Stripe subscriptions to handle $$k+/month revenues
* Full-text search with Elastic
* Docker, Docker, Docker
* A lot of cloud - mostly AWS
* Some product management
* A bit of marketing

Do not hesitate to drop me a line, I try to answer any message. If you are in Zurich, let's grab a drink.
